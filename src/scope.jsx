        <h3>PROJECT SCOPE</h3>
        <p> Using the NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date) dataset, the main 
                objective of this project is to use machine learning techniques 
                for predictive crime analysis. The scope includes thorough 
                preprocessing and cleaning of the data, as well as a thorough 
                exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, correlations, and 
                distributions of crime. To improve machine learning models' 
                predictive power, feature engineering will be used. The main 
                goal of the project is to use machine learning models that have 
                been carefully chosen and trained to solve a specific prediction 
                problem, such the kind or location of crimes. The models will 
                be refined using evaluation criteria, and a deployment phase 
                that takes privacy and ethical considerations into account will 
                be optional for real-time crime predictions. The project 
                prioritizes openness and the moral use of sensitive data to 
                provide useful insights and suggestions for law enforcement 
                tactics. For feedback and validation, stakeholder involvement 
                with local government, law enforcement, and communities is 
                essential. A cleansed dataset, an exploratory data analysis 
                report, machine learning models that have been trained, useful 
                insights, and thorough documentation are among the 
                deliverables. In the fast-paced setting of New York City, the 
                project aims to support data-driven decision-making in law 
                enforcement while promoting community relations and public 
                safety.
