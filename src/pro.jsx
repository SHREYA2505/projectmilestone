            <h3>PROPOSED APPROACH</h3>
            <p>1. 
                Data Preparation, Cleaning and Preprocessing: Data 
                preparation and cleaning are essential to ensure the quality and 
                integrity of the dataset. We will address missing values, outliers, 
                and inconsistencies to create a reliable dataset for analysis. 
             </p>
            <p>2. 
                Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical 
                Analysis: To find patterns, trends, and linkages in the data, EDA 
                and statistical analysis will be used. To acquire preliminary 
                insights, we will use descriptive statistics and visualize the data. 
            </p>
            <p> 3. 
                Clustering and Identifying Influencing Factors: To 
                discover groups or trends in the data, we will use clustering 
                algorithms. This step seeks to identify connections or 
                influencing elements that lead to crime trends. 
            </p>
            <p>4. 
                Data Visualization: Extensive data visualization will 
                be used to illustrate and make accessible the findings. 
                Visualization will be critical in identifying high- and low-crime 
                regions, as well as the SDOH characteristics connected with 
                them. Visualizations will be used to analyze and pick the most 
                and least observed locations for further investigation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                5. 
                Communicating results: Finally, the data analysis 
                insights and results are clearly and concisely presented. 
            </p>
            <p> We propose to use a combination of exploratory data analysis 
                and statistical analysis techniques. Explorative data analysis 
                helps in understanding the data and identifying potential trends 
                and patterns. Following that, we will use statistical analysis to 
                validate these patterns and gain deeper insights. We plan to 
                experiment with various methods and then choose the one that 
                provides the most useful insights.
