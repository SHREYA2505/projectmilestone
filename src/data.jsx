        <h3>DATA SOURCE</h3>
            <p>The primary data source for this project is the “NYPD Arrest 
                Data (Year to Date)” dataset, which is publicly available on the 
                NYC Open Data portal and on the DATA.gov website. This 
                dataset provides comprehensive information about every arrest 
                made by the NYPD during the current year, including details 
                about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement, 
                and suspect demographics. The data is manually extracted 
                every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management 
                Analysis and Planning. This dataset will serve as the foundation 
                for our analysis and insight generation. [1]: </p>
