                on their relevance to the problem statement and their potential 
                impact on policing strategies. We will also use a portion of the 
                dataset as a hold-out test set to evaluate the robustness of our 
                insights on unseen data. The visualizations and outputs will be 
                achieved using various techniques, analytics methods, and tools.
